This directory contains several segment testset generators taken from
or inspired by LEDA.

Generators

- gen_leda_sweep_time_difficult.cpp
  - The generator based on demo/sweep_time.cpp - DIFFI mode only
- gen_leda_sweep_time_random.cpp
  - The generator based on demo/sweep_time.cpp - RANDOM mode only
- gen_leda_highly_degenerate.py
  - A generator that generates 100 random segments in a side-length
    100 grid.
- gen_leda_circle_segments.cpp
  - A generator that generates two rotated overlapping n-gons.

Helper

- gen_leda.sh
  - Run all generators above with parameters as used in LEDA
    publications or determined by us.
    - The instances not representable within 64bit numbers are
      dropped.
  - The output instances are put into the testsets/ subfolder.

How to use

First, compile the generators with:

cmake .
cmake --build

Then run the generator script:

./gen_leda.sh
